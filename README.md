# The-Exorcist-s-codex--character-s-items-unofficial-

This is compendiums of professions, skills, backgrounds, and motivations, to create Characters and play The Exorcist's codex RPG (Two Starving Gnolls) on Foundry VTT with the BRP System .

This is A Work in Progress. Don't expect everything to be upright. This is more a quick and dirty trick to be able to create characters and play The Exorcist's Codex in Foundry VTT Quickly.

For now , only "professions", "skill categories" and "skills" compendiums are filled. Motivations and backgrounds will follow as i have the time !

These materials are used with direct,
project-specific permission granted exclusively to the creator of this
module (Natha) by Two Starving Gnolls AS. This permission applies only to
this module and does not extend to any other person, project, or
publication. See the LICENCE for details

INSTALL :
1- Install the module as usual, then 
2- Open new brp world, activate module, then 
3- Import FIRST, KEEPING THE BRPID, (with right-click) all the content of the "TEC skill categories" , 
4- Import SECOND,all the "TEC Skills" the same way (keeping brpid) , then 
5- Import LAST, in the same manner "TEC Professions". 
Otherwise there will be an error when you drag skills or profession onto your character sheets.
I have included a TEC logo image and a TEC title image into the asset folder to change brp character sheets title in the settings and put The exorcist's codex title in place :) For the logo switch, this is more tricky (no option in the menu, you have to paste the logo file in the /system/brp/assets/ and replace the file, and will have to redo every time brp update the module :/ ) 

Concerning Spirit Points you can set Sanity "on" in the optional rules settings and use the rules from "The Exorcist Codex" for Spirit Points with the SAN pool (unfortunately brp system setting doesn't let you change the 'Sanity' name for now, so you cannot have your custom "Spirit Points" name on the Cs).

For Holy Faith rating , you can enable "Custom Resource" (in the optional rules settings also) and label it "Holy Faith"

For those GMs interested in reflecting the demon dices, there is a module called dice pool which you can use :) (just browse fvtt modules)

Good Play !
