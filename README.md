# The-Exorcist-s-codex--character-s-items-unofficial-

This is compendiums to play The Exorcist's codex RPG (Two Starving Gnolls) on Foundry VTT with BRP System .

This is a Draft for now, A Work in Progress. Don't expect everything to be upright. This is a quick and dirty trick to be able to play The Exorcist's Codex in Foundry VTT with the BRP system, but this is not an official module.
Thank you for your understanding

For now , only "professions", "skill categories" and "skills" compendiums are filled. Motivations, backgrounds will follow as i have the time !
INSTALL :
First Install the module as usual, then open brp world, activate module, then import, KEEPING THE BRPID, the content of the "TEC skill categories" FIRST Before you import ALL the "TEC Skills". Otherwise there will be an error when you drag skills to your character sheets and sums won't work.
I have included a TEC logo image and a TEC title image into the asset folder to change brp character sheets title in the settings and put The exorcist's codex title in place :) For the logo switch, this is more tricky (no option in the menu, you have to paste the logo file in the /system/brp/assets/ and replace the file, and will have to redo every time brp update the module :/ ) 

Concerning Spirit Points you can set Sanity "on" in the optionnal rules settings and use the rules from "The Exorcist Codex" for Spirit Points with the SAN pool (unfortunately brp system setting doesn't let you change the 'Sanity' name for now, so you cannot have your custom "Spirit Points" name on the Cs).

For those GMs interested in reflecting the demon dices, there is a module called dice pool which you can use :) (just browse fvtt modules)

Good Play !
